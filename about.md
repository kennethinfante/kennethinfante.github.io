# Hi! I'm Kenneth Infante
I started my career as a accountant. I was very good at using Microsoft Excel and Netsuite and began to venture in the programming capabilities of these softwares using VBA and SuiteScript respectively. Through the years, I became curious about how programming can make my repetitive tasks in accounting easier. I've also witnessed how softwares like Python, SQL and the like expands the capabilities of Excel and allows accountants to do analysis not possible before. This led me to my second career in Data Analytics. I taught myself Python and SQL and soon began using these at my daily work as an analyst. I believe that my knowledge of accounting and analytics sets me apart as I'm able to make sense of business data and spot any error as they arise in the analytics process.

I am passionate about accounting and analytics, and I'm currently expanding my expertise to include data engineering skills.

I currently looking for work that utilizes my expertise and industry knowledge and allows me to grow as a Data Analyst.
